👋 Hi, I’m Alec ( @alec0902 )

👀 I’m interested in technology. I like to know how things are made from basic to its complete form. Being able to make life easier for people is something
that I want to contribute for the society which is why I really want to learn AI at some point because of Automation! I do other stuffs in my spare time
like learning a new hobby ( something that pique's my interest ), gardening ( I really want to grow stuffs at some point ), maybe farming? ( I play simulation games a lot ex. Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Dont Starve Together, Oxygen Not Included, Factorio etc), 
space ( likes to see space news ), finance ( budgeting, investing and stuffs. I just like numbers incrementing ) and many more.

🌱 I’m currently learning web development! I'm still on the basics which are the 3 languages for Frontend Development. HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I will be moving on to Backend Development once I am comfortable with developing through Frontend. And at some point will try to make Mobile App/ Desktop App as well.
Once I know most of this stuff. I will be branching out to more advanced/complex programming like Machine Learning, making my own APIs, Game Development(maybe)
AR, VR and more! The good thing about programming is there is always something new to learn!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software related stuffs!

📫 How to reach me. I have a LinkedIn Profile, Discord and my Github profile. You can also reach me through my Email!
